# Coding challenges
This is my favorite hobby!

This repo contains <b>python</b> code that I write to solve problems found in:

<ul>
<li>Adevent of Code - https://adventofcode.com/</li>
<li>CodinGame - https://www.codingame.com</li>
<li>Daily Coding Problem - https://www.dailycodingproblem.com</li>
</ul>

I enjoy expanding my <b>programming capabilities</b> and <b>problem solving skills</b>.
In coding I prefer <b>readability</b> over code-golfing.
However, I do code-golf challenges for fun in CodinGame, as this helps me expand my coding vocabulary.

Good <b>performace</b> is a must, so the computational complexity is always considered.

Once I've read: <i>"If it works and scales, who cares!"</i>

I do! As a <b>perfectionist</b> I turn-back to <b>beautify</b> my solutions even though they work well. I love doing <b>refactoring</b> :-). Actualy, everything around <b>code-quality</b> draws my attention.
